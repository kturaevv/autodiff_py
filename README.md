## Deep learning library

In progress ...

P.S. I plan to add lots of cool stuff, like a Tensor Storage, numba JIT compiler for parallelization and efficiency (or maybe rewrite it in C?), implement from cratch popular DL algos e.t.c All in the name of acquiring deeper insight. As of now, for implementation of various ML algorithms refer to my [previous](https://github.com/kturaevv/snnl) project.
